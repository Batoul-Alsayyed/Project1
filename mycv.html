       <h1 class="color">Hello, my name is Batoul Alsayyed</h1>
       <p class="color">I am a computer science graduate from Beirut Arab University and a student at SE factory.
          <br/>
          I am 21, I am a highly organised person so coding was a great job for someone like me who 
          pays attention to the smallest details. 
          <br/>
          I am an ambitious, adventurous person who always 
          thrives to learn new concepts, whenever I feel like I have ome free time,<br/> I like to Users
          it to learn something new annd by that it doesn't necessary have to be something related to
          my domain, sometimes it is completely different to what I am doing.
